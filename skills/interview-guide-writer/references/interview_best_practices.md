## Building Rapport and Trust

### First Impressions Matter
- **Warm introduction**: Smile, make eye contact, use friendly tone
- **Show genuine interest**: Express curiosity about their experience
- **Be human**: Share brief context about yourself to establish connection
- **Respect their time**: Acknowledge their time is valuable

### Creating Safe Space
- **Reassure confidentiality**: Emphasize anonymization early and often
- **Non-judgmental stance**: Make clear there are no "right" or "wrong" answers
- **Active listening signals**: Nod, use verbal affirmations ("I see", "That makes sense")
- **Match their energy**: Mirror their communication style (formal vs. casual)

### Trust-Building Language
- ✅ "I'm really curious to understand..."
- ✅ "There are no right or wrong answers—I just want to hear your experience"
- ✅ "Everything you share is confidential and will be anonymized"
- ❌ "You should feel comfortable sharing..." (creates pressure)
- ❌ "Everyone else said..." (creates conformity pressure)

## Question Types and When to Use Them

### Open-Ended Questions
**Purpose**: Elicit detailed, nuanced responses

**Structure**: Start with "How", "Why", "What", "Tell me about"

**Examples**:
- "How do you currently approach [task]?"
- "What challenges do you face when [scenario]?"
- "Tell me about a time when [situation]"

**When to use**: Core questions, when you want depth and detail

### Closed Questions
**Purpose**: Confirm facts, narrow focus

**Structure**: Yes/no, multiple choice, specific data points

**Examples**:
- "How many people are on your team?"
- "Do you use [tool] daily or weekly?"

**When to use**: Sparingly—only for factual confirmation or screening

### Probing Questions
**Purpose**: Go deeper, clarify, get specific examples

**Types**:
1. **Elaboration probes**: "Can you say more about that?"
2. **Example probes**: "Can you walk me through a specific time when..."
3. **Clarification probes**: "When you say [X], what do you mean exactly?"
4. **Contrast probes**: "How is that different from [Y]?"
5. **Exception probes**: "Has there ever been a time when that wasn't the case?"

**When to use**: After initial answer to any core question

### Hypothetical Questions
**Purpose**: Explore preferences, priorities, trade-offs

**Examples**:
- "If you could wave a magic wand..."
- "If you had [resource], what would you do?"
- "Imagine you're advising someone facing this challenge—what would you tell them?"

**When to use**: When direct questions might lead to socially desirable answers

### Comparative Questions
**Purpose**: Understand priorities and decision-making

**Examples**:
- "How does [X] compare to [Y] in your priorities?"
- "If you had to choose between [A] and [B], which would you prioritize and why?"

**When to use**: Budget discussions, priority assessment, trade-off analysis

## Probing Techniques and Follow-Up Strategies

### The Power of Silence
**Technique**: After participant finishes, pause 2-3 seconds before responding

**Why it works**: People often continue speaking after a pause, revealing deeper thoughts

**When to use**: After any answer that feels incomplete or when they seem to be holding back

### Echoing and Reflecting
**Technique**: Repeat their last few words with a questioning tone

**Example**:
- Participant: "I just don't have time for research"
- Interviewer: "Don't have time?"
- Participant: *elaborates on time constraints*

**Why it works**: Prompts elaboration without inserting your own framing

**When to use**: When you want them to expand without leading them in a direction

### Ladder Down (Specific Details)
**Technique**: Ask for progressively more specific details

**Example**:
- "What challenges do you face?" → "What makes that challenging?" → "Walk me through the last time that happened"

**Why it works**: Moves from abstract to concrete, reveals actual behavior vs. perception

**When to use**: When answers are vague or theoretical

### Ladder Up (Broader Context)
**Technique**: Ask for broader implications or patterns

**Example**:
- "You mentioned X was frustrating" → "Is that typical of your experience?" → "How does that affect your overall approach?"

**Why it works**: Connects specific instances to general patterns and decision-making

**When to use**: After hearing specific examples, to understand broader implications

### Following the Energy
**Technique**: Notice when participant lights up or shows emotion, dig deeper there

**Signals to watch for**:
- Voice becomes more animated
- Leans forward, gestures more
- Speaks faster or with more detail
- Shows frustration, excitement, or strong feeling

**When to use**: Throughout the interview—energy indicates salience

## Active Listening and Note-Taking

### Listening Hierarchy
1. **Listen for content**: What they're saying
2. **Listen for emotion**: How they feel about it
3. **Listen for what's unsaid**: What they're avoiding or implying

### Note-Taking Best Practices
**During interview**:
- Capture verbatim quotes that are particularly insightful
- Note body language and tone shifts
- Mark moments of energy or emotion
- Jot down follow-up questions to ask later

**Immediately after interview**:
- Spend 2-3 minutes on field notes while fresh
- Record key observations and surprises
- Note audio quality issues
- Flag particularly strong quotes for analysis

### Balancing Listening and Note-Taking
- Prioritize listening over writing
- Use shorthand or abbreviations
- Write down just enough to jog memory during analysis
- Rely on recording for verbatim content
- Make eye contact more than look at notes

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Leading Questions
**Pitfall**: "Don't you think [X] would be valuable?" or "Most people find [X] frustrating, do you?"

**Why it's bad**: Suggests the "right" answer, creates social desirability bias

**Fix**: "How do you feel about [X]?" or "What's your experience with [X]?"

### Double-Barreled Questions
**Pitfall**: "How often do you use the tool and what do you like about it?"

**Why it's bad**: Participant may only answer one part, other part gets lost

**Fix**: Ask one question at a time, wait for full answer before moving on

### Assuming Understanding
**Pitfall**: Moving on without clarifying jargon or vague terms

**Why it's bad**: Miss important nuances, may misinterpret data

**Fix**: "When you say [term], what exactly do you mean?" or "Can you define what you mean by [X]?"

### Filling Silence Too Quickly
**Pitfall**: Jumping in immediately after participant stops talking

**Why it's bad**: Cuts off deeper reflection and elaboration

**Fix**: Count to 3 before responding; let them sit with the question

### Going Off-Script Too Much
**Pitfall**: Following every tangent, losing track of research questions

**Why it's bad**: May miss critical questions, run out of time

**Fix**: Gently redirect—"That's really interesting. I want to make sure we cover [X]. Let me ask you about..."

### Showing Bias or Judgment
**Pitfall**: "Oh, you don't do research? That's surprising" or "Wow, that's a great approach!"

**Why it's bad**: Makes participant defensive or seek approval

**Fix**: Stay neutral—"Tell me more about that" or "What led you to that approach?"

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Rushed or Distracted Participant
**Challenge**: Participant looking at phone, checking time, giving short answers

**Strategy**:
- Acknowledge time constraint: "I know you're busy. Let me focus on the most important questions."
- Offer to reschedule: "Would another time work better?"
- Speed up: Skip less critical questions, focus on 1-2 key topics

### Surface-Level Responses
**Challenge**: Participant gives generic, brief answers without depth

**Strategy**:
- Use example probes: "Can you walk me through a specific time when..."
- Express genuine curiosity: "That's interesting—I'd love to understand more about..."
- Use silence: Pause after they finish to encourage elaboration
- Ask "Why?" multiple times (respectfully)

### Defensive or Guarded Participant
**Challenge**: Participant seems uncomfortable, gives evasive answers

**Strategy**:
- Reassure confidentiality: "Everything you share is anonymized"
- Normalize their experience: "I've heard others mention similar challenges"
- Give them an out: "You can skip any question if you prefer"
- Shift to easier topics first, build trust before sensitive questions

### Rambling or Off-Topic Participant
**Challenge**: Participant goes on long tangents unrelated to research questions

**Strategy**:
- Gently interrupt: "I'm so sorry to cut you off, but I want to make sure we have time for [X]"
- Redirect politely: "That's fascinating. It makes me think of [related topic]. Can you tell me about..."
- Time check: "We have about 5 minutes left. Let me make sure we cover [critical question]"

### Overly Agreeable Participant
**Challenge**: Participant says "yes" to everything, seeks to please

**Strategy**:
- Ask for trade-offs: "If you had to choose between X and Y, which would you prioritize?"
- Request specifics: "Can you describe the last time you actually did that?"
- Use projective techniques: "What would someone else in your position struggle with?"

### Technical Difficulties
**Challenge**: Recording fails, loud background noise, connection issues

**Strategy**:
- Have backup recording method ready (second device)
- Move to quieter location if possible
- Take detailed notes as backup
- Offer to do brief follow-up via email if data is lost

## Consent and Ethics Guidelines

### Obtaining Informed Consent

**Required elements**:
1. **Purpose**: What the research is for
2. **How data will be used**: Internal insights, reports, publications
3. **Confidentiality**: How their identity will be protected
4. **Voluntary participation**: They can stop or skip questions
5. **Recording**: Explicit permission to record
6. **Contact info**: How to reach you with questions

**Best practices**:
- Get verbal consent at start of recording (creates audio record)
- Use plain language, not legal jargon
- Allow time for questions before starting
- Offer written consent form if appropriate
- Confirm they understand and agree

### Ensuring Confidentiality

**Anonymization techniques**:
- Use participant numbers (P1, P2) instead of names
- Remove identifying details in quotes (company names, product names, geographic locations)
- Aggregate data when presenting findings
- Store recordings/transcripts securely
- Delete raw audio after analysis period (specify retention policy)

**When to break confidentiality**:
- Only when legally required (harm to self/others, illegal activity)
- Clarify limitations of confidentiality upfront if relevant

### Power Dynamics and Vulnerable Populations

**Consider power imbalances**:
- Employer-employee research (be extra clear about confidentiality)
- Researching "down" in hierarchy (may fear repercussions)
- Cultural differences in authority and speaking up

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Emphasize independent researcher role
- Use third-party interviewer when possible
- Offer anonymous response options
- Be aware of cultural norms around directness

## Recording Best Practices

### Pre-Interview Setup
- **Test equipment**: Record 30 seconds, play back to verify audio quality
- **Have backup**: Use two devices if possible (phone + recorder)
- **Check battery and storage**: Ensure enough capacity for full interview
- **Choose quiet location**: Scout locations in advance for intercepts
- **Position recorder**: Close to participant, away from ambient noise

### During Interview
- **Start recording before consent**: Capture verbal consent on audio
- **Monitor recording**: Quick glance to confirm it's running
- **Hold device properly**: Don't rustle papers near microphone
- **Minimize interruptions**: Silence your phone, close laptop

### Post-Interview
- **Verify recording**: Play back to ensure audio captured
- **Label immediately**: Name file with participant number and date
- **Back up to cloud**: Upload to secure cloud storage same day
- **Check audio quality**: Listen to a few minutes while fresh; re-recruit if unusable

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Low volume**: Hold device closer, ask participant to speak up slightly
- **Background noise**: Move locations if possible, note issue for transcription
- **Device malfunction**: Switch to backup device immediately, apologize briefly

## Adapting to Different Interview Contexts

### Remote vs. In-Person

**Remote considerations**:
- Test video/audio before start
- Share screen for visual stimuli
- Be extra animated to compensate for screen distance
- Use chat for links or follow-up questions
- Account for potential technical disruptions

**In-person advantages**:
- Better rapport building
- Observe body language more easily
- Can show physical materials
- Fewer technical issues

### Intercept vs. Scheduled

**Intercept challenges**:
- Participants may be distracted or rushed
- Limited time for depth
- Need to qualify quickly
- Noisy environments

**Intercept strategies**:
- Perfect your pitch (5-second value prop)
- Have ultra-focused question set
- Accept shorter, lighter responses
- Take more field notes (less reliance on audio)

### Individual vs. Group Interviews

**Group dynamics**:
- Dominant voices may overshadow quieter participants
- Group consensus may hide individual perspectives
- Can spark discussion and build on ideas

**Group facilitation**:
- Explicitly invite all voices: "I'd love to hear from everyone on this"
- Use round-robin for key questions
- Notice and probe divergence: "I'm hearing different perspectives here..."
- Manage time carefully (more voices = less time per person)
